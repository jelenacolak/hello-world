# hello-world
This is my first repository.
I'm currently a Senior at DePaul University in Chicago, IL. I will be graduating this summer with a Bachelors of Science in Interactive and Social Media. My degree is a combination of User Experience Desgin and Information Technology and has exposed me to many different branches of Web Development and Design. I look forward to sharing my projects and collaborating with the GitHub community.
